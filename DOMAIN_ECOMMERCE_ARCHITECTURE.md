# Domain Architecture – E-Commerce

## 1. Purpose
Primary backbone domain to exercise transactional integrity (OLTP), event propagation, multi-protocol interaction, and derived data patterns.

## 2. Bounded Contexts & Services

| Context              | Service                                             | Responsibility                               | Initial Status |
|:---------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------|
| Catalog              | product-service                                     | Product CRUD, price versioning               | Phase 1        |

## 3. Protocol Usage Matrix

| Use Case                  | Protocol                  | Rationale                          |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------|

| Order lifecycle events    | Kafka events              | Decoupled downstream consumers     |
| Flash sale broadcast      | SSE                       | One-way scalable updates           |
| Real-time order status    | WebSocket                 | Bidirectional channel (future ack) |
| Payment gateway           | SOAP + REST fallback      | Legacy simulation & resilience     |
| Outbound partner updates  | Webhooks + RabbitMQ retry | External integration reliability   |
| IoT stock adjustments     | MQTT ingest → Kafka       | Device realism                     |
| Batch sales summary       | Batch job                 | Deferred computation               |
| Streaming revenue metrics | Kafka Streams             | Near real-time dashboard           |

## 4. External Interfaces (Stable Contract Surfaces)
REST (simplified):
- POST /api/v1/products
- GET /api/v1/products/{id}
- POST /api/v1/orders  (Headers: Idempotency-Key, Correlation-Id)
- POST /api/v1/orders/{id}/pay
- POST /api/v1/orders/{id}/cancel
- GET /api/v1/orders/{id}

GraphQL (later):
```
type Query {
  product(id: ID!): Product
  products(filter: ProductFilter): [Product]
  productInventory(id: ID!): InventoryInfo
}
```

gRPC (inventory):
```
service Inventory {
  rpc ReserveStock(ReserveRequest) returns (ReserveResponse);
  rpc ReleaseStock(ReleaseRequest) returns (ReleaseResponse);
  rpc QueryStock(StockQuery) returns (StockStatus);
}
```

WebSocket Channels:
- /ws/orders (subscribe {orderId} or personal channel)
SSE:
- /sse/flash-sales

Outbound Webhooks:
- HMAC-SHA256 signature header: X-BV-Signature
- Retry schedule: 30s, 2m, 5m, 15m, 30m → DLQ event after max

SOAP Payment (WSDL simulated):
- Operation: ProcessPayment(orderId, amount, currency)

MQTT Topics:
- iot/inventory/{sku}/delta  (payload: { "delta": -2, "reason": "SENSOR" })

## 5. Data Architecture (OLTP → Derived → OLAP)
OLTP (Postgres):
- products, product_price_history (SCD2)
- orders, order_items, order_status_history
- carts, cart_items
- payments
- inventory_stock, inventory_adjustment
- webhook_subscriptions, webhook_delivery_attempts

CDC: Debezium captures orders, inventory_adjustment, product changes.

Derived Serving:

| Projection           | Store                      | Built From                  |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------|:----------------------------|
| orders_by_customer   | Cassandra                  | domain events + CDC status  |
| inventory_snapshot   | Redis + Cassandra          | inventory.adjusted events   |
| product_search_index | OpenSearch (later)         | product.updated event       |
| flash_sale_price_map | Redis                      | pricing.* events            |
| daily_revenue        | ClickHouse / Streams state | order.paid / order.canceled |

OLAP / Warehouse:
- fact_orders, fact_inventory_adjustments, dim_product, dim_date

No Dual Write Rule: Application writes only to Postgres; all projections built via Kafka streams or connectors.

## 6. Events (Authoritative)
| Event Type                              | Purpose                   | Partition Key       |
|:----------------------------------------|:--------------------------|:--------------------|
| ecommerce.order.order.created.v1        | Start lifecycle           | orderId             |
| ecommerce.order.order.paid.v1           | Payment success           | orderId             |
| ecommerce.order.order.canceled.v1       | Compensation              | orderId             |
| ecommerce.order.order.fulfilled.v1      | Completion                | orderId             |
| ecommerce.inventory.stock.adjusted.v1   | Stock delta broadcast     | productId           |
| ecommerce.product.product.updated.v1    | Cache/search invalidation | productId           |
| ecommerce.pricing.flash_sale.started.v1 | Broadcast sale            | productId or saleId |
| ecommerce.webhook.delivery.failed.v1    | Alert operations          | subscriptionId      |

Canonical Payload (example order.created):
```
{
  "eventId": "...",
  "eventType": "ecommerce.order.order.created.v1",
  "occurredAt": "...",
  "producer": "order-service",
  "traceId": "...",
  "correlationId": "...",
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "partitionKey": "ORDER-123",
  "payload": {
    "orderId": "ORDER-123",
    "userId": "USER-9",
    "totalAmount": 129.50,
    "currency": "USD",
    "items": [{"productId":"P1","qty":2,"price":25.00}]
  }
}
```

## 7. Caching Strategy
| Cache                  | Key                     | Policy                 | Invalidation                  |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|:-----------------------|:------------------------------|
| Product read           | product:{id}            | Read-through           | product.updated               |
| Inventory              | inventory:{productId}   | Event-driven set       | inventory.stock.adjusted      |
| Order status ephemeral | order_status:{orderId}  | Write-through on event | fulfillment/cancel remove     |
| Flash sale price       | flash_price:{productId} | Cache authority TTL    | sale end event/TTL            |
| GraphQL aggregated     | gql:product:{id}        | Short TTL (30s)        | Same as underlying components |

## 8. Resilience & Retry Matrix
| Operation               | Pattern                                 | Limits                      |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------------|
| Payment SOAP            | Exponential w/ jitter + circuit breaker | 5 attempts                  |
| Inventory Reserve gRPC  | Exponential (bounded)                   | 3 attempts                  |
| Webhook dispatch        | Progressive schedule + DLQ              | 5 attempts                  |
| Event publish           | Async retry + DLQ fallback              | configurable                |
| Flash sale price update | Fast fail (no retry)                    | propagate error upward      |
| MQTT ingestion          | Buffer & batch after reconnect          | device-level QoS simulation |

## 9. Security (Domain-Specific)
- Auth: JWT required on all mutations.
- Authorization: Customer may cancel only PENDING orders they own; OPA policy.
- Sensitive actions (price override) require ADMIN role.
- Idempotency: Hash Idempotency-Key + payload; reject duplicates within 24h window.
- Payment tokenization future: integrate Vault transit for card token (learning optional).

## 10. Observability Targets
Metrics:
- orders_created_total
- order_creation_latency_ms (histogram)
- inventory_reservation_failures_total
- webhook_retry_attempts_total
- product_cache_hit_ratio
Traces:
- POST /orders → gRPC ReserveStock → Kafka publish sequence
Logs:
- Correlation: orderId, traceId, userId, eventType

## 12. Implementation Phases
| Phase  | Deliverables                                     |
|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Product + Cart (REST + Postgres + basic tests)   |
| 2      | Order + Inventory gRPC stub + Kafka events       |
| 3      | WebSocket notifications + Redis caching          |
| 4      | Payment SOAP + Partner webhooks + flash sale SSE |
| 5      | Pricing service + Kafka Streams metrics + CDC    |
| 6      | IoT MQTT ingestion (inventory adjustments)       |
| 7      | Cassandra projections + OpenSearch indexing      |
| 8+     | DR replay + advanced resilience                  |

## 13. Interoperability Checklist (Before Declaring Stable)

- [ ] All events validated vs schema registry
- [ ] GraphQL fields do not leak internal table names
- [ ] gRPC proto version pinned & published
- [ ] REST endpoints documented with status codes & error model
- [ ] Cache invalidation tied to event consumption only (no side-channels)
- [ ] Idempotency semantics documented & test present
- [ ] Replay procedure tested on sample dataset
- [ ] Security (OPA) denies invalid cancellation scenario

## 14. Backlog Seed (Chronological by Complexity)
1. Product CRUD + migrations + unit tests
2. Order creation + event envelope lib usage
3. Inventory gRPC proto + in-memory stub
4. Redis product cache + invalidation test
5. WebSocket notification skeleton
6. Payment adapter mock + SOAP client stub
7. Webhook dispatcher + retry queue (RabbitMQ)
8. Pricing flash sale event emission
9. Kafka Streams order revenue aggregation
10. Debezium CDC capture for orders/products
11. Cassandra orders_by_customer projection
12. Replay CLI skeleton
13. OpenSearch indexing pipeline

## 15. Cost Controls
- Defer Cassandra & OpenSearch until after stable events (Phase 5+).
- Use single-broker Kafka or Redpanda early.
- Run SOAP + RabbitMQ only when working that phase (compose profile).
- Edge resources (ingress/gateway) consolidated early to one load balancer.

## 16. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                      | Mitigation                                          |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Event schema churn        | Freeze MVP schema early; additive evolution only    |
| Cache staleness bugs      | Integration tests with consumer-driven expectations |
| Payment circuit thrashing | Configure conservative sliding window for breaker   |
| Webhook backlog growth    | DLQ monitoring & alert threshold                    |

## 17. Exit Criteria for Domain “MVP Complete”
- Order→Notification real-time path traced
- Stock adjustment via event updates inventory snapshot
- Payment failure path triggers retries & circuit open
- Replay reconstructs orders_by_customer with parity
- GraphQL resolved aggregated product + inventory
